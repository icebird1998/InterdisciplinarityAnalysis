# Interdisciplinarity Analysis for Geology based on Semantic
This repository contains the source code for the study â€œMeasuring Interdisciplinarity in Geology: A Semantic Analysis Approach".

1. The Dataset folder is aim to store the data propressing files, and the core data file is store in Figshare repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29949071).
   
2. The create_database.ipynb is aim to transform the vector to domain through the semantic vector.

3. The analysis.ipynb is aim to analysis the interdisciplinarity between geology and each major scientific domain.

4. The n-gram.ipynb is aim to analysis the hot topics.

5. The add_llm.ipynb and the consistency_LLM_embedding.ipynb are the code of supplementary experiments. These mainly focus on using LLMs for text classification and assessing the consistency between LLM and semantic-based approach (embedding and semantic similarity).

6. The subdomain_analysis.ipynb is aim to further conducted interdisciplinary analysis on the sub-disciplines
